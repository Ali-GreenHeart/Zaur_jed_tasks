        The earliest traces of human habitation in the Peking municipality were
        found in the caves of Dragon Bone Hill near the village of Zhoukoudian
        in Fangshan District, where Peking Man lived. Homo erectus fossils from
        the caves date to 230,000 to 250,000 years ago.

        Paleolithic Homo sapiens also lived there more recently, about 27,000
        years ago. Archaeologists have found neolithic settlements throughout
        the municipality, including in Wangfujing, located in central Peking.

        After the First Emperor unified China, Jicheng became a prefectural
        capital for the region. During the Three Kingdoms period, it was held by
        Gongsun Zan and Yuan Shao before falling to the Wei Kingdom of Cao Cao.
        The AD 3rd-century Western Jin demoted the town, placing the prefectural
        seat in neighboring Zhuozhou.
